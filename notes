what is ResponseEntity ?? is it an object, then of which class?

Yes, ResponseEntity is an object, and it is a part of the Spring Framework. Specifically, it is a class in the org.springframework.http package.
public class ResponseEntity<T> extends HttpEntity<T>

Key Details about ResponseEntity
Class:

It is a class provided by Spring, defined as:
java

public class ResponseEntity<T> extends HttpEntity<T>
T is the generic type, which represents the body of the response.
Purpose:

It represents the entire HTTP response, including:
Status Code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
Headers
Body (the content/data being returned)

Inheritance:
ResponseEntity extends HttpEntity, which means it inherits the ability to handle HTTP headers and body.

-------------------
Usage in Spring Controllers
ResponseEntity is commonly used in Spring controllers to send responses for REST APIs. For example:

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/example")
public ResponseEntity<String> getExample() {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK)
                         .body("This is an example response.");
}
When a client calls the endpoint /example, they will receive:

Status Code: 200 OK
Body: "This is an example response."

The <String> in ResponseEntity<String> refers to the type of the response body.
It specifies that the body of the HTTP response will be a String.
 ------------------------------------

Q))
so in the above calling the getExample()  method and declaring it, is it done at the same place
ans::
No, calling the getExample() method and declaring it are not done at the same place. Here's why:

Declaration:::
The method getExample() is declared in your controller class, 
where you define its behavior and annotate it with @GetMapping("/example") to map it to the /example endpoint.

This is a server-side operationâ€”you define it so that the Spring framework 
knows what to execute when a request is sent to the specified endpoint.

Calling::
The method is called by the Spring framework when a client sends an HTTP GET request to the /example endpoint.
This happens automatically because the @GetMapping annotation registers the method as a handler for the /example path.
The calling of the method is triggered by the request, not by explicit code elsewhere.

Declaration (Server-side):

Done in the backend by the developer.
example is above

Calling (Client-side):

Triggered by the client when an HTTP GET request is sent to /example.
Example using a browser, Postman, or cURL:
eg:
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/example
The Spring framework identifies the matching method (getExample() in this case) based on the @GetMapping annotation and executes it.

Analogy:
Think of the getExample() method as a button on a webpage:

Declaring the method is like placing the button on the page and defining what happens when it is clicked. --done by developers as in the above
Calling the method is like a user clicking the button, which triggers the defined action.   --- comes form the front end side, when a click is made by the user
--- routing is done by spring framework

-------------------------------------------------------------

Routing by Spring Framework:
Explanation: Spring Framework acts as the "traffic controller," routing incoming HTTP requests to the correct method based on annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc., and the request's path and type.
Process:::
User sends a request (e.g., GET /example).
Spring matches this request to the method annotated with @GetMapping("/example").
Spring executes the method (getExample()) and returns the result to the client.

if (bankingAccounts.isEmpty()) {
    return new ArrayList<>();
}

what will be the type of new ArrayList<>();  is it same as List<BankingAccountReadModel> 
ans::

Yes, the type of new ArrayList<>() in this context will be the same as List<BankingAccountReadModel>.

Explanation:
Type Inference:

Java's diamond operator (<>) enables type inference for generic types based on the context.
Here, the method's return type is declared as List<BankingAccountReadModel>. Therefore, the compiler infers the type for new ArrayList<>() as ArrayList<BankingAccountReadModel>.
Compatibility:

ArrayList implements the List interface, so new ArrayList<>() can be assigned to a variable or returned in a method expecting a List.
Result:

The returned new ArrayList<>() is effectively a List<BankingAccountReadModel>.
 equivalent code::
if (bankingAccounts.isEmpty()) {
    return new ArrayList<BankingAccountReadModel>();
}
