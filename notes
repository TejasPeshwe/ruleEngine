my findings 



what is ResponseEntity ?? is it an object, then of which class?

Yes, ResponseEntity is an object, and it is a part of the Spring Framework. Specifically, it is a class in the org.springframework.http package.
public class ResponseEntity<T> extends HttpEntity<T>

Key Details about ResponseEntity
Class:

It is a class provided by Spring, defined as:
java

public class ResponseEntity<T> extends HttpEntity<T>
T is the generic type, which represents the body of the response.
Purpose:

It represents the entire HTTP response, including:
Status Code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
Headers
Body (the content/data being returned)

Inheritance:
ResponseEntity extends HttpEntity, which means it inherits the ability to handle HTTP headers and body.

-------------------
Usage in Spring Controllers
ResponseEntity is commonly used in Spring controllers to send responses for REST APIs. For example:

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/example")
public ResponseEntity<String> getExample() {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK)
                         .body("This is an example response.");
}
When a client calls the endpoint /example, they will receive:

Status Code: 200 OK
Body: "This is an example response."

The <String> in ResponseEntity<String> refers to the type of the response body.
It specifies that the body of the HTTP response will be a String.
